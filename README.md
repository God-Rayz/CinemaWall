## 🎯 Why I Built This

I created CinemaWall completely **free** because I wanted a live wallpaper app without:
- ❌ In-app purchases
- ❌ Ads
- ❌ Trackers
- ❌ Unnecessary file permissions

This app is built with privacy and user experience in mind. No hidden costs, no data collection, just a clean, functional video wallpaper app that does exactly what it promises.
